## Known issues

- The `FileSystemRecorder` class sometimes writes invalid JSON into its "SyncState.json" file causing it to not
  being able to restore and recover from that when the app using the recorder restarts (e.g. the "vbustouch-proxy"
  example).
- The `ConfigurationOptimizers` do not yet detect the firmware version running on the controller to be configured.
  That sometimes causes configuration loads and saves to fail because unknown values are read from or written to
  (e.g. using the "customizer" example on a DeltaSol MX with firmware version 1.11 or below).



## Short-term plans

- Remove current `ConfigurationOptimizer` constructs in favor of RESOL's official support.

## Changelog

## Work in progress


## Version 0.24.0 (2021-09-12)

- [BREAKING CHANGE] Replaced the deprecated "request" dependency with Fetch API impl
    Since the "request" dependency that was used in the `DLxRecorder` class has
    been deprecated, the code was refactored to use a Fetch API implementation instead.
    But since the method `DLxRecorder#downloadToStream` expected "request"-specific options,
    it had to be changed, too. This method was renamed to `DLxRecorder#_downloadToStream` to
    indicate that it is a class-private method and its signature was changed to accept
    Fetch API specific options.


## Version 0.23.0 (2021-05-14)

- [BREAKING CHANGE] Replacing custom inheritance code with `class` syntax
    Up to this version inheritance was established using a custom `extend` function.
    Since only modern ECMAscript runtimes are supported since the last release the code was
    refactored to use the ECMAscript `class` syntax instead. In that process the `extend`
    function was removed, both the standalone one and the static class function that was
    added to every "class".
- [BREAKING CHANGE] Returning a `Promise` from `channelListCallback` callback
    The `TcpConnection` accepts a `channelListCallback`. This callback gets called with the
    list of channels returned from the `CHANNELLIST` command and a `done` callback.

    Up to this version the return value of the `channelListCallback` was ignored. Starting
    with this version this behaviour is changed if the return value of the callback is
    a `Promise`:
    - if the `Promise` reject, the `done` callback is automatically called with `done(reason)`
    - if the `Promise` resolves, the `done` callback is automatically called with
      `done(null, result)`

    This allows the `channelListCallback` to be `async`.
- Errors thrown by `TcpConnection#connect` now have a `vbusPhase` member describing on which
  VBus-over-TCP command the error occurred


## Version 0.22.0 (2021-05-10)

- [BREAKING CHANGE] Dropping support for Node.js versions < 12


## Version 0.21.0 (2020-05-02)

- [BREAKING CHANGE] Returning a `Promise` from `filterPacket` or `filterDatagram` callbacks
    The `Connection#transceive` method and many of the helper methods that use it
    accept a `filterPacket` and/or `filterDatagram` callback. Those callbacks get called
    with the data to filter and a `done` callback.

    Up to this version the return value of the filter callbacks was ignored. Starting with
    this version this behaviour is changed if the return value of the filter callbacks is
    a `Promise`:
    - if the `Promise` rejects, the `done` callback is automatically called with `done(reason)`
    - if the `Promise` resolves with `null` or `undefined`, the `done` callback is not called
    - if the `Promise` resolves with any other result, the `done` callback is automatically
      called with `done(null, result)`

    This allows `async` filter callbacks!
- Add `SerialConnection#baudrate` option.
- Stop running Travis tests under Node 6.
    Some dependency of `jest` does not work under Node 6 making tests break
    for that target. The `resol-vbus` library itself might still work under
    Node 6, but there is no guarantee...


## Version 0.20.0 (2019-06-15)

- This version contains several breaking changes! You have been warned...
	- Refactor code to make use of ES2018 features (using Babel to back-support up to Node.js 6)
	- Remove custom `Promise` implementation in favor of built-in, native one.
	- `Promise` return values no longer provide the `finally` and `done` methods.
	- Remove `utils.promise`, `utils.Promise` and `utils.cancelablePromise`.
	- Add `reportProgress` and `checkCanceled` options to `ConnectionCustomizer#transceive{Configuration,Value}` as a replacement to the previously used `cancelablePromise` solution.
- Add RESOL DeltaSol C configuration optimizer.
- Add support for VBus-over-TCP wrapped in TLS.
